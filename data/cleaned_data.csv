While ONTAPSpot could have been a match made in multicloud heaven you instead have folks like CastAI tackling it And the various ways that ONTAP could have enabled this are all orphaned,0,0.678007185459137
Its a great question and since they also have CloudCheckr we cant view Spot as a cloud cost manager of which there are 20 players But NetApp pursued partner with each cloud and did MultipleCloudsWhichisNotMultiCloud Result,1,0.5811636447906494
Well the value of ONTAP is significant and it is certainly NetApps biggest asset Its a pretty great piece of software with many wellintegrated and useful parts And I hope they got the value from AWS they deserve But a fit with their acquisitions And either driving growth,2,0.9469488859176636

Im sure AWS loves that ONTAP inside AWS surrounded by a SaaS marketplace of infinite solutions to all the other data problems But for NTAP I think its a bit like they decided to go the office for the QBR and forgot their pants,2,0.7843017578125
I think missing the server hardware side of the equation still makes any of the other suitors less appealing Even if they compliment each other That full stack is a compelling argument,1,0.5676155686378479
Consider how much of the remaining revenue is simply a buyandgrow of things like Spot CloudJumper CloudCheckr If theyre really serious about software then not playing in metadata mgmt governance etc Instead they invested a ton in putting their core value into AWS,1,0.6921711564064026
Its definitely possible but revenue doesnt lie 10K says product rev mix was 5545 softwarehw under product revenue eg not supportps Now look at a few NetApp quotes and see how much the ONTAP licensing is And then,1,0.8017967939376831
